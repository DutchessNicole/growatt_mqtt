# Growatt MQTT

Forked from a fork, there is still code that needs to be cleaned up.
Currently, inverter status (0 idle, 1 active, 3 error), actual power (Watt) and PV voltage work and tested on a Growatt MIC 1500TL-X inverter.

Original read.me:

_This is still a work in progress 14-09-2019._

This application is build for an ESP8266, tested on NodeMCU.
It reads values from an growatt solar power inverter, mitsubishi heat exchanger and whr930 mechanical ventilation using modbus. These value are published using MQTT for use with for example Home Assistant or any other application of your preference.

## Wiring

You will need to use an RS485 -> TTL adapter, when using and ESP8266 make sure to use an 3.3V compatibale one. If your adapter does not have automatic TX/RX switching you will need additional wiring to pull down/up the correct pins.

ESP8266 --> RS485 to TTL --> Growatt Inverter.

## Home Assistant
Use the following sensors to integrate with Home Assistant
